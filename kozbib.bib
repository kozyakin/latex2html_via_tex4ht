                  for stability analysis of discrete time switched systems.
                  These are polynomial Lyapunov functions that have an
                  algebraic certificate of convexity, and can be efficiently
                  found by semidefinite programming. We show that convex
                  polynomial Lyapunov functions are universal (i.e.,
                  necessary and sufficient) for stability analysis of
                  switched linear systems. On the other hand, we show via an
                  explicit example that the minimum degree of an sos-convex
                  Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily higher than a
                  (non-convex) polynomial Lyapunov function. (The proof is
                  omitted.) In the second part, we show that if the switched
                  system is defined as the convex hull of a finite number of
                  nonlinear functions, then existence of a non-convex common
                  Lyapunov function is not a sufficient condition for
                  switched stability, but existence of a convex common
                  Lyapunov function is. This shows the usefulness of the
                  computational machinery of sos-convex Lyapunov functions
                  which can be applied either directly to the switched
                  nonlinear system, or to its linearization, to provide proof
                  of local switched stability for the nonlinear system. An
                  example is given where no polynomial of degree less than 14
                  can provide an estimate to the region of attraction under
                  arbitrary switching.",

                  recently introduced by Asarin et al. They model the
                  situation in which one player (Despot) wishes to minimize
                  the growth rate of a matrix product, whereas the other
                  player (Tribune) wishes to maximize it. We develop an
                  operator approach to entropy games. This allows us to show
                  that entropy games can be cast as stochastic mean payoff
                  games in which some action spaces are simplices and
                  payments are given by a relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler
                  divergence). In this way, we show that entropy games with a
                  fixed number of states belonging to Despot can be solved in
                  polynomial time. This approach also allows us to solve
                  these games by a policy iteration algorithm, which we
                  compare with the spectral simplex algorithm developed by
                  Protasov.",

                  guarantee that all these notions lead to the same value. In
                  particular, we give a Collatz-Wielandt type formula, which
                  characterizes the growth rate of the orbits in terms of
                  eigenvectors in the closed cone or super-eigenvectors in
                  the interior of the cone. This characterization holds when

                  involving an essential spectral radius defined in terms of

                  small mismatching of operating times of system components.
                  On the other hand, lack of synchronization can be built

                  asynchronous algorithms are exploited in parallel
                  processing. Too, a system may be susceptible of change by
                  numerous factors at different, asynchronous times. In all

                  stochastic matrices $W_k$ emerge in various settings, like
                  opinion formation in social networks, rendezvous of robots,
                  and distributed inference in sensor networks. The matrices
                  $W_k$ are often random, due to, e.g., random packet
                  dropouts in wireless sensor networks. Key in analyzing the
                  performance of such systems is studying convergence of
                  matrix products $W_kW_{k-1} \cdots W_1$. In this paper, we
                  find the exact exponential rate $I$ for the convergence in
                  probability of the product of such matrices when time $k$
                  grows large, under the assumption that the $W_k$'s are
                  symmetric and independent identically distributed in time.
                  Further, for commonly used random models like with gossip
                  and link failure, we show that the rate $I$ is found by
                  solving a min-cut problem and, hence, easily computable.
                  Finally, we apply our results to optimally allocate the
                  sensors' transmission power in consensus+innovations
                  distributed detection.\par Our analysis reveals that the
                  exponential rate of convergence in probability depends only
                  on the statistics of the support graphs of the random
                  matrices. Further, we show how to compute this rate for
                  commonly used random models: gossip and link failure. With
                  these models, the rate is found by solving a min-cut
                  problem, and hence it is easily computable. Finally, as an
                  illustration, we apply our results to solving power

                  establishes that a projective IFS has at most one

                  solving a number of important problems of numerical
                  mathematics. From advent of parallel computers these have
                  been used for a broad variety of large-sized and time
                  demanding applications. Model numerical problems serve in
                  benchmarks to test every new parallel computer system
                  appearing on the market.\par From a mathematical point of
                  view, the monograph deals with analysis, design and
                  implementation of parallel numerical algorithms. On a space
                  of more than one hundred pages an adequate introductory
                  knowledge about general aspects of parallel processing is
                  given. The kernel of the book is structured into two main
                  parts. The first part is devoted to synchronous algorithms
                  while the second one is oriented towards methods which are
                  based on the asynchronous execution principle.\par There
                  are five chapters which describe parallel synchronous
                  algorithms. A detailed attention is paid to solving linear
                  systems of equations with general and special matrices in
                  the first chapter of them. The next chapter treats
                  nonlinear problems. The synchronous part concludes chapters
                  for the shortest path problem, dynamic programming and
                  network flow analysis.\par A class of totally asynchronous
                  methods with some theoretical formulations is the subject
                  of the first chapter in the asynchronous part of the book.
                  The subsequent chapter is devoted to partially asynchronous
                  algorithms, i.e. when some amount of synchronization is
                  introduced in the algorithm. The final chapter of the
                  monograph presents a design of an asynchronous network of
                  processors for realization of a general type of parallel
                  algorithms.\par It is to recommend the book to those
                  readers who deal seriously with solving numerical problems
                  on advanced computers with parallel architecture. It is not
                  just a ``cooking book'' containing algorithmic recipes but
                  there can be found enough from the theory of parallel
                  numerics itself.",

                  pairwise differences do not contain some given forbidden
                  difference patterns is known to increase exponentially with
                  $n$; the coefficient of the exponent is the capacity of the
                  forbidden patterns. In this paper, new inequalities for the
                  capacity are given that allow for the approximation of the
                  capacity with arbitrary high accuracy. The computational
                  cost of the algorithm derived from these inequalities is

 annote        = "The joint spectral radius of a set of matrices is a measure
                  of the maximal asymptotic growth rate that can be obtained
                  by forming long products of matrices taken from the set.
                  This quantity appears in a number of application contexts
                  but is notoriously difficult to compute and to approximate.
                  We introduce in this paper a procedure for approximating
                  the joint spectral radius of a finite set of matrices with
                  arbitrary high accuracy. Our approximation procedure is
                  polynomial in the size of the matrices once the number of
                  matrices and the desired accuracy are fixed.\par For the
                  special case of matrices with non-negative entries we give
                  elementary proofs of simple inequalities that we then use
                  to obtain approximations of arbitrary high accuracy. From
                  these inequalities it follows that the spectral radius of
                  matrices with non-negative entries is given by the simple
                  expression \[\rho(A_1, \ldots, A_m)= \lim_{k \rightarrow
                  \infty} \rho^{1/k} ( A_1^{\otimes k} + \cdots +
                  A_m^{\otimes k})\] where it is somewhat surprising to
                  notice that the right hand side does not directly involve
                  any mixed product between the matrices ($A^{\otimes k}$
                  denotes the $k$-th Kronecker power of $A$).\par For
                  matrices with arbitrary entries (not necessarily
                  non-negative) we introduce an approximation procedure based
                  on semi-definite liftings that can be implemented in a
                  recursive way. For two matrices, even the first step of the
                  procedure gives an approximation whose relative accuracy is
                  at least ${1 / \sqrt{2}}$, that is, more than $70\%$. The
                  subsequent steps improve the accuracy but also increase the
                  dimension of the auxiliary problems from which the
                  approximation can be found.\par Our approximation
                  procedures provide approximations of relative accuracy
                  $1-\epsilon$ in time polynomial in $n^{(\ln m) /\epsilon}$,
                  where $m$ is the number of matrices and $n$ is their size.
                  These bounds are close from optimality since we show that,
                  unless P=NP, no approximation algorithm is possible that
                  provides a relative accuracy of $1-\epsilon$ and runs in
                  time polynomial in $n$ and $1/\epsilon$.\par As a
                  by-product of our results we prove that a widely used
                  approximation of the joint spectral radius based on common
                  quadratic Lyapunov functions (or on ellipsoid norms) has
                  relative accuracy $1/\sqrt m$, where $m$ is the number of
                  matrices.",

                  computed in polynomial time as solutions of convex
                  optimization problems. We show that these bounds are within
                  a factor $1/n$ of the exact value, where n is the size of
                  the matrices. Moreover, for sets of matrices with
                  independent column uncertainties or with independent row
                  uncertainties, the corresponding bounds coincide with the
                  joint spectral radius. In these cases, the joint spectral
                  radius is also given by the largest spectral radius of the
                  matrices in the set. As a by-product of these results, we

                  answer this question negatively. As discovered by Horowitz
                  around fifty years ago, there are products of matrices that
                  always have the same spectral radius despite not being
                  cyclic permutations of one another. We show that the
                  simplest Horowitz products can be spectrum maximizing in a
                  robust way; more precisely, we exhibit a small but nonempty
                  open subset of pairs of $2 \times 2$ matrices $(A,B)$ for
                  which the products $A^2 B A B^2$ and $B^2 A B A^2$ are both
                  spectrum maximizing.",

                  set of real $d \times d$ matrices is defined to be the
                  smallest possible exponential growth rate of long products
                  of matrices drawn from that set. The lower spectral radius
                  arises naturally in connection with a number of topics
                  including combinatorics on words, the stability of linear
                  inclusions in control theory, and the study of random
                  Cantor sets. In this article we apply some ideas
                  originating in the study of dominated splittings of linear
                  cocycles over a dynamical system to characterise the points
                  of continuity of the lower spectral radius on the set of

                  a residual set, and discuss some implications of this

                  that for all $M\in A$, and all $z\in C^{n}$,
                  $|Mz|<|z|$.\par The norm is a \emph{Liapunov function} for
                  the set $A$. It need not be smooth; using smooth norms to
                  prove stability can be inadequate. A novel central result
                  is a constructive algorithm which can determine the
                  stability of $A$ based on the following.\par
                  \emph{Theorem:} $A = \{M_0,M_1,\ldots,M_{m-1}\}$ is a set
                  of $m$ distinct complex matrices. Let $W_0$ be a bounded
                  neighborhood of the origin. Define for $k > 0$, \[W_k =
                  \textrm{convex~hull}~\left[\bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}
                  M_{k'}^{i}W_{k-1}\right]\] where $k'=(k- 1) \mod m$. Then
                  $A$ is stable if and only if $W^{*}\equiv
                  \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}W_{i}$, is bounded.\par $W^{*}$ is the
                  norm of the first theorem. The constructive algorithm
                  represents a convex set by its extreme points and uses
                  linear programming to construct the successive $W_k$.
                  Sufficient conditions for the finiteness of constructing
                  $W_k$ from $W_{k-1}$, and for stopping the algorithm when
                  either the set is proved stable or unstable are presented.
                  $A$ is generalized to be any convex set of matrices. A
                  dynamical system of differential equations is stable if a
                  corresponding set of matrices -- associated with the
                  logarithmic norms of the matrices of the linearized
                  equations -- is stable. The concept of the stability of a
                  set of matrices is related to the existence of a matrix
                  norm. Such a norm is an induced matrix norm if and only if
                  the set of matrices is maximally stable (i.e., it cannot be
                  enlarged and remain stable).",

                  applications but is known to be difficult to approximate.
                  Several approaches to approximate the joint spectral radius
                  involve the construction of long products of matrices, or
                  the construction of an appropriate extremal matrix norm. In
                  this article we present a brief overview of several recent
                  approximation algorithms and introduce a genetic algorithm
                  approximation method. This new method does not give any
                  accuracy guarantees but is quite fast in comparison to
                  other techniques. The performances of the different methods

                  these are simply too expensive to compute with other

                  $\Sigma$ of $n\times n$ matrices is the maximal asymptotic
                  growth rate that can be obtained by forming products of
                  matrices from $\Sigma$. This quantity is NP-hard to compute
                  and appears in many areas, including in system theory,
                  combinatorics and information theory. A dozen algorithms
                  have been proposed this last decade for approximating the
                  joint spectral radius but little is known about their
                  practical efficiency. We overview these approximation
                  algorithms and classify them in three categories:
                  approximation obtained by examining long products, by
                  building a specific matrix norm, and by using
                  optimization-based techniques. All these algorithms are now
                  implemented in a (freely available) MATLAB toolbox that was
                  released in 2011. This toolbox allows us to present a
                  comparison of the approximations obtained on a large number
                  of test cases as well as on sets of matrices taken from the
                  literature. Finally, in our comparison we include a method,
                  available in the toolbox, that combines different existing
                  algorithms and that is the toolbox's default method. This
                  default method was able to find optimal products for all

                  of the joint spectral radius for the discrete-time case.
                  The purpose of this paper is to provide a characterization
                  of marginally unstable systems, i.e., systems for which the

                  consists in pointing out a resonance phenomenon associated
                  with marginal instability. In the course of our study, we
                  derive an upper bound of the state at time t, which is

                  set of matrices. We say that a set of matrices has the
                  finiteness property if the maximal rate of growth, in the
                  multiplicative semigroup it generates, is given by the
                  powers of a finite product.\par Here we address the problem
                  of establishing the finiteness property of pairs of
                  $n\times n$ sign-matrices. Such problem is related to the
                  conjecture that pairs of sign-matrices fulfil the
                  finiteness property for any dimension. This would imply, by
                  a recent result by Blondel and Jungers, that finite sets of
                  rational matrices fulfil the finiteness property, which
                  would be very important in terms of the computation of the
                  joint spectral radius. The technique used in this paper
                  could suggest an extension of the analysis to $n\times n$
                  sign-matrices, which still remains an open problem.\par As
                  a main tool of our proof we make use of a procedure to find
                  a so-called real extremal polytope norm for the set. In
                  particular, we present an algorithm which, under some
                  suitable assumptions, is able to check if a certain product
                  in the multiplicative semigroup is spectrum maximizing.\par
                  For pairs of sign-matrices we develop the computations
                  exactly and hence are able to prove analytically the
                  finiteness property. On the other hand, the algorithm can
                  be used in a floating point arithmetic and provide a
                  general tool for approximating the joint spectral radius of
                  a set of matrices.",

                  (ITMs) with, on the circle, two intervals, also known as
                  ``double rotations''. ITMs are either of finite or infinite
                  type. If they are of finite type they reduce to interval
                  exchange-transformations (IETs). It is argued that by using
                  the induction procedure described by Suzuki et al, we can
                  demonstrate several properties of double rotations. We show
                  that almost every double rotation is of finite type, with
                  respect to Lebesgue measure. Further we show that a typical
                  double rotation is uniquely ergodic. Next we consider
                  complexity. It is trivially true that, in the case of IETs
                  complexity is linear. However, contrary to expectation,
                  there are double rotations with super-linear complexity.
                  Finally we give approximations for the dimension of the set
                  of all infinite double rotations.",

 annote        = "The conjecture that periodically switched stability implies
                  absolute asymptotic stability of random infinite products
                  of a finite set of square matrices, has recently been
                  disproved under the guise of the finiteness conjecture. In
                  this paper, we show that this conjecture holds in terms of
                  Markovian probabilities. More specifically, let $S_{k}\in
                  \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, $1\le k\le K$, be arbitrarily
                  given $K$ matrices and $\Sigma^{+}_{K} =
                  \{(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}~ |~ 1\le k_j\le K~ \textrm{for
                  each}~j\ge 1\}$, where $n, K \ge 2$. Then we study the
                  exponential stability of the following discrete-time
                  switched dynamics $S$: \[ x_j = S_{k_j}\cdots S_{k_1}
                  x_0,\quad j\ge 1~\textrm{and}~ x_0\in \mathbb{C}^n\] where
                  $(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}\in \Sigma^{+}_{K}$ can be an
                  arbitrary switching sequence. For a probability row-vector
                  $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots, p_K )\in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ and an
                  irreducible Markov transition matrix $\mathsf{P}\in
                  \mathbb{R}^{K\times K}$ with $\mathbf{p}\mathsf{P} =
                  \mathbf{p}$, we denote by $\mu_{\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P}}$ the
                  Markovian probability on $\Sigma^{+}_{K}$ corresponding to
                  $(\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P})$. By using symbolic dynamics and
                  ergodic-theoretic approaches, we show that, if $S$
                  possesses the periodically switched stability then, (i) it
                  is exponentially stable
                  $\mu_{\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P}}$-almost surely; (ii) the set
                  of stable switching sequences $(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}\in
                  \Sigma^{+}_{K}$ has the same Hausdorff dimension as
                  $\Sigma^{+}_{K}$. Thus, the periodically switched stability
                  of a discrete-time linear switched dynamics implies that
                  the system is exponentially stable for ``almost'' all
                  switching sequences.",

                  $\|S_{\sigma_{\!n}}\cdots S_{\sigma_{\!1}}\|\to0$ driven by
                  all switching signals $\sigma$) if and only if
                  $\rho(S_1),\rho(S_2)$ and $\rho(S_1S_2)$ all are less than
                  $1$; (2) For the case $d=3$, $\boldsymbol{S}$ is absolutely
                  stable if and only if $\rho(A)<1\;\forall
                  A\in\{S_1,S_2\}^\ell$ for $\ell=1,2,3,4,5,6$, and $8$. This
                  further implies that for any

                  $\rho(\boldsymbol{S})=1$ where $d=2$ or $3$, if
                  $\boldsymbol{S}$ has a common, but not strict in general,

                  Solutions of such equations arise in spline theory, in

                  equations. In particular, it characterizes $L^1$-solutions

                  with each element drawn from $\Sigma$ converge. Such sets
                  of matrices arise in constructing self-similar objects like
                  von Koch's snowflake curve, in various interpolation
                  schemes, in constructing wavelets of compact support, and
                  in studying nonhomogeneous Markov chains. This paper gives
                  necessary conditions and also some sufficient conditions
                  for a set $\Sigma$ to be an RCP set. These are conditions
                  on the eigenvalues and left eigenspaces of matrices in
                  $\Sigma$ and finite products of these matrices. Necessary
                  and sufficient conditions are given for a finite set
                  $\Sigma$ to be an RCP set having a limit function
                  $\mathsf{M}_{\Sigma}(d)=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathsf{A}_{d_{i}}$,
                  where $\mathsf{d}=(d_1,\ldots,d_n,\ldots)$, which is a
                  continuous function on the space of all sequences
                  $\mathsf{d}$ with the sequence topology. Finite RCP sets of
                  column-stochastic matrices are completely characterized.
                  Some results are given on the problem of algorithmically
                  deciding if a given set $\Sigma$ is an RCP set.",

                  true for the case $n = 2$, but is not true in general.
                  Their results imply that there exists some minimal integer
                  $n_p$ such that the conjecture is true for all $n < n_p$,
                  but is not true for $n = n_p$. We show that $n_p = 3$.",

                  is the well-known uniform recurrence which translates the

                  the topological system cannot be split into smaller
                  systems. The second one is the fact that the topological

                  subsystems. First, sufficient conditions for testing
                  stability, based on the existence of special classes of
                  common Lyapunov functions, are investigated, and these
                  conditions are mutually related, thus proving that if a
                  linear copositive common Lyapunov function can be found,
                  then a quadratic positive definite common function can be
                  found, too, and this latter, in turn, ensures the existence
                  of a quadratic copositive common function. Secondly,
                  stabilizability is introduced and characterized. It is
                  shown that if these systems are stabilizable, they can be
                  stabilized by means of a periodic switching sequence, which
                  asymptotically drives to zero every positive initial state.
                  Conditions for the existence of state-dependent stabilizing
                  switching laws, based on the values of a copositive
                  (linear/ quadratic) Lyapunov function, are investigated and
                  mutually related, too.\par Finally, some properties of the
                  patterns of the stabilizing switching sequences are
                  investigated, and the relationship between a sufficient
                  condition for stabilizability (the existence of a Schur
                  convex combination of the subsystem matrices) and an
                  equivalent condition for stabilizability (the existence of
                  a Schur matrix product of the subsystem matrices) is

                  which reduces the implementation needed to perform encoding

                  framing errors caused by incorrect coding or faulty bit
                  detection. All code words utilized in this scheme are
                  constrained to have distinctive word-ending bit sequences.
                  Word-ending tests are performed repeatedly at strategic
                  points in the bit stream in order to detect bit patterns
                  that may denote word endings, and framing decisions are
                  based upon these tests. Decoding functions are suspended
                  while each new code word or frame is being serially entered
                  into the input register for decoding. Where misframing
                  occurs due to the presence of an erroneous bit in a code
                  word, the propagation of such a framing error through
                  subsequent words is limited by the fact that subsequent
                  word-ending tests are performed independently of the
                  framing decisions that preceded them, and also due to the
                  fact that the average code word length is much less than in
                  a fixed-length code system. Synchronism is quickly restored
                  upon detecting a valid word-ending bit pattern following
                  the erroneous bit. While the code words are of variable
                  length, the rate of data transmission is constant due to a
                  fixed ratio between the number of original data bits and
                  the corresponding encoded data bits.",

                  complex matrices $(A, B)$ under the simultaneous similarity
                  $(TAT^{-1}, TBT^{-1})$. Roughly speaking, the

                  the set of $n \times n$ complex-valued matrices). Here $r$

                  komplexen Zahlen) linearer, normierter vollst{\"a}ndiger
                  Raum im Sinne von Banach, in dem eine Multiplikation
                  erkl{\"a}rt ist, die ihn zu einem kommutativen Ring macht,
                  in dem ein Einheitselement $e$ vom Betrag 1 existiert und
                  stets $\| x\cdot y\|\leq \| x\| \cdot \| y\|$ gilt., Ist
                  $R$ ein K{\"o}rper, so ist $R$ gleich dem K{\"o}rper der
                  komplexen Zahlen. Dies wird mit funktionentheoretischen
                  S{\"a}tzen bewiesen. Eine Funktion $x(\lambda )$, $\lambda
                  $ komplex, $x\in R$, hei{\ss}t analytisch in einem Bereich,
                  wenn dort $\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{x(\lambda
                  +h)-x(\lambda )}{h}$ im Sinn der Konvergenz nach der Norm
                  existiert. Die S{\"a}tze der gew{\"o}hnlichen
                  Funktionentheorie {\"u}bertragen sich auf diese Funktionen
                  leicht, da f{\"u}r jedes lineare Funktional $f(x)$ die
                  Funktion $f(x(\lambda ))$ analytisch im {\"u}blichen Sinn
                  wird. Jedes Ideal von $R$ ist in einem maximalen Ideal $M$
                  enthalten, dessen Restklassenring $R/M$ dem K{\"o}rper der
                  komplexen Zahlen isomorph ist. Jedem Element $x\in R$ wird
                  so die Funktion $x(M)$ zugeordnet, wobei $x(M)$ die
                  komplexe Zahl ist, die die Restklasse von $x$ in $R/M$
                  darstellt. Ist $x(M)$ nirgends Null, so besitzt $x$ ein
                  inverses Element. Die Funktion $x(M)$ ist dann und nur dann
                  identisch Null, wenn $x$ im Durchschnitt aller maximalen
                  Ideale von $R$ liegt. Notwendig und hinreichend daf{\"u}r
                  ist, da{\ss} $x$ ein verallgemeinertes nilpotentes Element
                  ist, f{\"u}r das $\root n\of{\|\,x^n\,\|}\to 0$ geht.\par
                  Die Menge $\mathfrak{M}$ aller maximalen Ideale von $R$
                  wird zu einem topologischen Raum, wenn man als eine
                  Umgebung $U(M_0)$ alle $M\in\mathfrak{M}$ mit
                  $|\,x_i(M)-x_i(M_0)\,|<\varepsilon $, $i = 1$,\ldots, n,
                  $x_1$,\ldots, $x_n$ aus $R$, einf{\"u}hrt. $\mathfrak{M}$
                  ist bikompakt und gen{\"u}gt den Hausdorffschen Axiomen,
                  die $x(M)$ sind stetig auf $\mathfrak{M}$, also ist $R$
                  homomorph in den Ring $C(\mathfrak{M})$ aller auf
                  $\mathfrak{M}$ stetigen Funktionen abgebildet. Diese
                  Abbildung ist dann und nur dann eine Isomorphie, wenn $R$
                  kein Radikal, d. h. keine verallgemeinerten nilpotenten
                  Elemente, enth{\"a}lt. Ist $R$ separabel, so ist
                  $\mathfrak{M}$ metrisierbar. Besitzt $R$ eine endliche

                  fitness conjecture, which was recently disproved in its
                  more general formulation. The authors conjecture that the
                  validity of the fitness conjecture for a finite family of
                  nondetective type is equivalent to the existence of an
                  extremal norm in the class of convex polytope norms.
                  However, they are not able to prove the small complex
                  polytope extremality theorem under some more restrictive
                  hypotheses on the underlying family of matrices.\par In
                  addition, the obtained results assure a certain fitness
                  property on the number of vertices of the unit ball of the
                  extremal complex polytope norm, which could be very useful

                  actual computation of the spectral radius of the
                  family.\par Even though the obtained results are mostly
                  theoretical in nature, they have potential impact in
                  applications. This potential lies in the fact that, if
                  there is a prior knowledge that a certain set $\mathcal{F}$
                  has an extremal polytope norm, then one could devise
                  algorithms for the computation of the spectral radius
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ that rely on the computation of the

                  spectral characteristics of a family of linear operators,
                  the joint spectral radius (JSR) and the lower spectral
                  radius (LSR), which are well-known different
                  generalizations to a set of operators of the usual spectral
                  radius of a linear operator. In this paper we develop a
                  method which -- under suitable assumptions -- allows us to
                  compute the JSR and the LSR of a finite family of matrices
                  exactly. We remark that so far no algorithm has been
                  available in the literature to compute the LSR exactly. The
                  paper presents necessary theoretical results on extremal
                  norms (and on extremal antinorms) of linear operators,
                  which constitute the basic tools of our procedures, and a
                  detailed description of the corresponding algorithms for
                  the computation of the JSR and LSR (the last one restricted
                  to families sharing an invariant cone). The algorithms are
                  easily implemented, and their descriptions are short. If
                  the algorithms terminate in finite time, then they
                  construct an extremal norm (in the JSR case) or antinorm
                  (in the LSR case) and find their exact values; otherwise,
                  they provide upper and lower bounds that both converge to
                  the exact values. A theoretical criterion for termination
                  in finite time is also derived. According to numerical
                  experiments, the algorithm for the JSR finds the exact
                  value for the vast majority of matrix families in
                  dimensions $\leq$20. For nonnegative matrices it works
                  faster and finds the JSR in dimensions of order 100 within
                  a few iterations; the same is observed for the algorithm
                  computing the LSR. To illustrate the efficiency of the new
                  method, we apply it to give answers to several conjectures
                  which have been recently stated in combinatorics, number
                  theory, and formal language theory.",

                  numerical methods for differential equations often reduces
                  to the analysis of linear difference equations with
                  variable coefficients. This class of difference equations
                  leads to a family $\mathcal{F}$ of matrices depending on
                  some parameters and the behaviour of the solutions depends
                  on the convergence properties of the products of the
                  matrices of $\mathcal{F}$. To date, the techniques mainly
                  used in the literature are confined to the search for a
                  suitable norm and for conditions on the parameters such
                  that the matrices of $\mathcal{F}$ are contractive in that
                  norm. In general, the resulting conditions are more
                  restrictive than necessary. An alternative and more
                  effective approach is based on the concept of joint
                  spectral radius of the family $\mathcal{F}$,
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$. It is known that all the products of
                  matrices of $\mathcal{F}$ asymptotically vanish if and only
                  if $\rho(\mathcal{F})<1$. The aim of this chapter is that
                  to discuss the main theoretical and computational aspects
                  involved in the analysis of the joint spectral radius and
                  in applying this tool to the stability analysis of the
                  discretizations of differential equations as well as to
                  other stability problems. In particular, in the last

                  the search of optimal products in finite families, which
                  constitutes a fundamental step in the algorithms which we
                  discuss. The material we present in the final section is
                  part of an original research which is in progress and is

                  generally, the discrete linear inclusion DLI$(M)$ makes

                  exponential rate of growth of long products of matrices
                  drawn from that set. A set of matrices is said to have the
                  \emph{finiteness property} if there exists a periodic
                  product which achieves this maximal rate of growth.
                  J.~C.~Lagarias and Y.~Wang conjectured in 1995 that every
                  finite set of real $d \times d$ matrices satisfies the
                  finiteness property. However, T.~Bousch and J.~Mairesse
                  proved in 2002 that counterexamples to the finiteness
                  conjecture exist, showing in particular that there exists a
                  family of pairs of $2\times 2$ matrices which contains a
                  counterexample. Similar results were subsequently given by
                  V.~D.~Blondel, J.~Theys and A.~A.~Vladimirov and by
                  V.~S.~Kozyakin, but no explicit counterexample to the
                  finiteness conjecture has so far been given. The purpose of
                  this paper is to resolve this issue by giving the first
                  completely explicit description of a counterexample to the
                  Lagarias-Wang finiteness conjecture. Namely, for the set \[

                  \] we give an explicit value of \[\alpha_* \simeq
                  0.749326546330367557943961948091344672091327370236064317358024\ldots

                  real matrices is defined to be the maximum possible
                  exponential growth rate of products of matrices drawn from
                  that set. For a fixed set of matrices, a sequence of
                  matrices drawn from that set is called \emph{extremal} if
                  the associated sequence of partial products achieves this
                  maximal rate of growth. An influential conjecture of
                  \emph{J.~Lagarias} and \emph{Y.~Wang}~\cite{LagWang:LAA95}
                  asked whether every finite set of matrices admits an
                  extremal sequence which is periodic. This is equivalent to
                  the assertion that every finite set of matrices admits an
                  extremal sequence with bounded subword complexity.
                  Counterexamples were subsequently constructed which have
                  the property that every extremal sequence has at least
                  linear subword complexity. In this paper we extend this
                  result to show that for each integer $p\geq 1$, there
                  exists a pair of square matrices of dimension
                  $2^p(2^{p+1}-1)$ for which every extremal sequence has
                  subword complexity at least $2^{-p^2}n^p$.",

                  of their trajectories under three types of switching rules:
                  arbitrary switching, optimal switching, and random
                  switching. It is shown that the maximum exponential growth
                  rates of system trajectories over all initial states under
                  these three switching rules are completely characterized by
                  the radii of convergence of three suitably defined families
                  of functions called the strong, the weak, and the mean
                  generating functions, respectively. In particular,
                  necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential
                  stability of the switched linear systems are derived based
                  on these radii of convergence. Various properties of the

                  Its goal is twofold:\par First, it presents most research
                  work that has been done during his Ph.D., or at least the
                  part of the work that is related with the joint spectral
                  radius. This work was concerned with theoretical
                  developments (part I) as well as the study of some
                  applications (part II). As a second goal, it was the
                  author's feeling that a survey on the state of the art on
                  the joint spectral radius was really missing in the
                  literature, so that the first two chapters of part I
                  present such a survey. The other chapters mainly report
                  personal research, except Chapter 5 which presents an
                  important application of the joint spectral radius: the
                  continuity of wavelet functions.\par The first part of this
                  monograph is dedicated to theoretical results. The first
                  two chapters present the above mentioned survey on the
                  joint spectral radius. Its minimum-growth counterpart, the
                  \emph{joint spectral subradius}, is also considered. The
                  next two chapters point out two specific theoretical
                  topics, that are important in practical applications: the
                  particular case of nonnegative matrices, and the Finiteness
                  Property.\par The second part considers applications
                  involving the joint spectral radius. We first present the
                  continuity of wavelets. We then study the problem of the
                  capacity of codes submitted to forbidden difference
                  constraints. Then we go to the notion of overlap-free
                  words, a problem that arises in combinatorics on words. We
                  then end with the problem of trackability of sensor
                  networks, and show how the theoretical results developed in
                  the first part allow to solve this problem efficiently.",

                  generated matrix semigroups, when the matrices share one or
                  two invariant cones. For a bounded set
                  $\Sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, these characteristics
                  are the joint spectral radius $\rho(\Sigma)$ and the joint
                  spectral subradius $\check{\rho}(\Sigma)$ respectively,

                  that $\rho(\Sigma)$ is continuous w.r.t. the Hausdorff
                  distance, but $\check{\rho}(\Sigma)$ is not continuous. In
                  this paper the continuity of the joint spectral subradius
                  is proved in the neighborhood of sets of matrices that
                  leave an embedded pair of cones invariant.\par A convex
                  closed cone $K'$ is embedded in a cone
                  $K\subset\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ if

                  one says that $\{K,K'\}$ is an embedded pair.\par The main
                  theorem states that if $\Sigma$ is a compact set in
                  $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ which leaves an embedded pair of
                  cones invariant and $(\Sigma_k)$ is a sequence of sets in
                  $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ that converges to $\Sigma$ in the
                  Hausdorff metric, then
                  $\check{\rho}(\Sigma_k)\rightarrow\check{\rho}(\Sigma)$ as
                  $k\rightarrow\infty$.\par The author denotes by $\Sigma^t$
                  the set of products of length $t$ of matrices from the
                  bounded set $\Sigma$ of matrices which leave a cone $K$
                  invariant. He proves that if there exists $A\in \Sigma$
                  which is $K$-primitive (i.e. $\exists m\in\mathbb{N}$ such
                  that $A^m(K\setminus\{0\})\subset\text{int} K$), then both

                  matrices taken from the set can be obtained by a periodic
                  product. It was conjectured a decade ago that all finite
                  sets of real matrices have the finiteness property. This
                  ``finiteness conjecture'' is now known to be false but no
                  explicit counterexample is available and in particular it
                  is unclear if a counterexample is possible whose matrices
                  have rational or binary entries. In this paper, we prove
                  that all finite sets of nonnegative rational matrices have
                  the finiteness property if and only if \emph{pairs} of
                  \emph{binary matrices} do and we state a similar result

                  pairs of $2\times 2$ binary matrices have the finiteness
                  property. These results have direct implications for the
                  stability problem for sets of matrices. Stability is
                  algorithmically decidable for sets of matrices that have
                  the finiteness property and so it follows from our results
                  that if all pairs of binary matrices have the finiteness
                  property then stability is decidable for nonnegative
                  rational matrices. This would be in sharp contrast with the
                  fact that the related problem of boundedness is known to be
                  undecidable for sets of nonnegative rational matrices.",

 annote        = "The book presents a collection of results, observations, and
                  examples related to dynamical systems described by linear
                  and nonlinear ordinary differential and difference
                  equations. In particular, it considers dynamical systems
                  that are susceptible to analysis by the Lyapunov approach.
                  The book consists of 6 chapters. The first chapter is
                  devoted to examples that originate from different
                  applications and illustrate the way in which some special
                  classes of dynamical systems dovetail with the concepts of
                  matrix diagonal stability and the associated diagonal-type
                  Lyapunov functions. The second chapter presents the matrix
                  theory concepts of diagonal stability and also of
                  $D$-stability and gives the properties of these classes of
                  matrices. Chapter 3 introduces classes of dynamical systems
                  that admit diagonal-type Lyapunov functions and gives the
                  basic stability results. Chapter 4 shows how Jacobi-type
                  iterative methods for the solution of linear and nonlinear
                  equations and, more specifically, asynchronous versions of
                  these methods can be analysed, based on diagonal-type
                  Lyapunov functions. Chapter 5 shows and discusses the
                  occurrence of the diagonal structure, introduced in the
                  first chapter, in several classes of dynamical systems that
                  include neural networks, digital filters, passive PLC
                  circuits, and ecosystems. Finally, chapter 6 discusses
                  various applications of dynamical systems in which
                  diagonally stable structures can be used
                  advantageously.\par The book provides an essential
                  reference for new methods and analysis related to dynamical
                  systems described by linear and nonlinear ordinary
                  differential equations and difference equations. As such,
                  it is addressed to researchers, professionals, and
                  graduates in applied mathematics, control engineering,
                  stability of dynamical systems, convergence of algorithms,
                  and scientific computation. Familiarity with linear algebra
                  and matrix theory, as well as difference and differential
                  equations, is the mathematical background expected from its
                  readers. A prior knowledge of systems and control theory,
                  including Lyapunov stability theory, is also expected, at
                  least in sufficient measure to provide motivation for the
                  problems studied.",

                  partially ordered by some cones and operators in ordered
                  Banach spaces. Perhaps positivity is not always well known
                  and used in full; the present book indicates several
                  applications to (mainly linear) problems arising e.g. in
                  system theory, mechanics and mathematics (spectral theory,
                  numerical problems, forced oscillations in nonlinear
                  systems, problems of stability and so on). Among these
                  results, organized in the four chapters of the book, some
                  were previously available only in research journals and/or
                  in Russian; the list of references contains more than 200

                  following: basic notions; applications to spectral
                  properties; applications to iteration procedures; other
                  applications. Several exercises (of different difficulty,
                  often containing facts of independent interest) are spread

                  finite and $\|A_j\|_{\text{op}}\le 1$, then either
                  $\widehat\rho(\Sigma)< 1$ or $\widehat\rho(\Sigma) =
                  \overline\rho(\Sigma) = \overline\rho_k (\Sigma)^{1/k} = 1$
                  for some $k$.\par Results in this paper: FC is true iff NFC
                  is true for all operator norms. NFC is proved for a
                  relatively large class of operator norms. For polytope
                  norms and for the Euclidean norm, explicit upper bounds are
                  given for the least $k$ having $\overline\rho(\Sigma) =
                  \overline\rho_k (\Sigma)^{1/k}$, implying upper bounds for
                  generalized critical exponents for these norms.",

                  appears in a number of applications including the stability
                  of switched and hybrid systems. Many algorithms exist for
                  estimating the JSR but not much is known about how to
                  generate an infinite sequence of matrices with an optimal

                  currently known algorithms select a small sequence with
                  large spectral radius using brute force (or
                  branch-and-bound variants) and repeats this sequence

                  to this question, using the dual solution of a sum of
                  squares optimization program for JSR approximation. Our
                  algorithm produces an infinite sequence of matrices with an
                  asymptotic growth rate arbitrarily close to the JSR. The
                  algorithm naturally extends to the case where the allowable
                  switching sequences are determined by a graph or finite
                  automaton. Unlike the brute force approach, we provide a
                  guarantee on the closeness of the asymptotic growth rate to
                  the JSR. This, in turn, provides new bounds on the quality
                  of the JSR approximation. We provide numerical examples

                  aims to briefly survey recent results in this field. First,
                  the stability analysis for switched systems is reviewed. We
                  focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems
                  under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and
                  sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a
                  brief review of the stability analysis under restricted
                  switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the
                  switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety
                  of switching stabilization methods found in the literature
                  are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is
                  investigated, that is under what condition it is possible
                  to stabilize a switched system by properly designing
                  switching control laws. Note that the switching
                  stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive

 annote        = "The book is organized as follows. We start in Chapter 1 with
                  the basic notions in symbolic dynamical systems, such as
                  full shifts, shift spaces, irreducibility, and sliding
                  block codes. In Chapter 2 we focus on a special class of
                  shift spaces called shifts of finite type, and in Chapter 3
                  we study a generalization of these called sofic shifts.
                  Entropy, an important numerical invariant, is treated in
                  Chapter 4, which also includes an introduction to the
                  fundamental Perron-Frobenius theory of nonnegative
                  matrices. Building on the material in the first four
                  chapters, we develop in Chapter 5 the state-splitting
                  algorithm for code construction and prove the Finite-State
                  Coding Theorem. Taken together, the first five chapters
                  form a self-contained introduction to symbolic dynamics and
                  its applications to practical coding problems.\par Starting
                  with Chapter 6 we switch gears. This chapter provides some
                  background for the general theory of dynamical systems and
                  the place occupied by symbolic dynamics. We show how
                  certain combinatorial ideas like shift spaces and sliding
                  block codes studied in earlier chapters are natural
                  expressions of fundamental mathematical notions such as
                  compactness and continuity. There is a natural notion of
                  two symbolic systems being ``the same,'' or conjugate, and
                  Chapter 7 deals with the question of when two shifts of
                  finite type are conjugate. This is followed in Chapters 8
                  and 9 with the classification of shifts of finite type and
                  sofic shifts using weaker notions, namely finite
                  equivalence and almost conjugacy. Chapters 7, 8, and 9
                  treat problems of coding between systems with equal
                  entropy. In Chapter 10 we treat the case of unequal entropy
                  and, in particular, determine when one shift of finite type
                  can be embedded in another. The set of numbers which can
                  occur as entropies of shifts of finite type is determined
                  in Chapter 11. Also in that chapter we draw on the results
                  of Chapter 10 to prove a partial result towards
                  characterizing the zeta functions of shifts of finite type
                  (the zeta function is a function which determines the
                  numbers of periodic sequences of all periods). Some of
                  these results in turn are used in Chapter 12 to classify
                  shifts of finite type and sofic shifts up to a notion that
                  sits in between conjugacy and almost conjugacy. The main
                  result of Chapter 12 may be regarded as a generalization of
                  the Finite-State Coding Theorem, and tells us when one
                  sofic shift can be encoded into another in a natural way.
                  Chapter 13 contains a survey of more advanced results and
                  recent literature on the subject. This is a starting point
                  for students wishing to become involved in areas of current
                  research.\par The mathematical prerequisites for this book
                  are relatively modest. A reader who has mastered
                  undergraduate courses in linear algebra, abstract algebra,
                  and calculus should be well prepared. This includes
                  upper-division undergraduate mathematics majors,
                  mathematics graduate students, and graduate students
                  studying information and storage systems in computer
                  science and electrical engineering. We have tried to start
                  from scratch with basic material that requires little
                  background. Thus in the first five chapters no more than
                  basic linear algebra and one-variable calculus is needed:
                  matrices, linear transformations, similarity, eigenvalues,
                  eigenvectors, and notions of convergence and continuity
                  (there are also a few references to basic abstract algebra,
                  but these are not crucial). Starting with Chapter 6, the
                  required level of mathematical sophistication increases. We
                  hope that the foundation laid in the first five chapters
                  will inspire students to continue reading. Here the reader
                  should know something more of linear algebra, including the
                  Jordan canonical form, as well as some abstract algebra
                  including groups, rings, fields, and ideals, and some basic
                  notions from the topology of Euclidean space such as open
                  set, closed set, and compact set, which are quickly
                  reviewed.",

 annote        = "Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite set of $n\times n$ complex
                  matrices and for each $k\geq1$ let $\mathcal{F}_{k}$ denote
                  the set of all products $A_{1}\cdots A_{k}$ of length $k$
                  with each $A_{i}\in\mathcal{F}$. The joint spectral radius
                  of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as $\rho(\mathcal{F}):=
                  \inf_{\left\|~\right\|}\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}}\left\|A\right\|$
                  where the infimum is taken over all sub-multiplicative
                  matrix norms. The authors are interested in methods of
                  computing $\rho(\mathcal{F})$.\par It can be shown that
                  \[\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}\rho(A)^{1/k}\leq
                  \rho(\mathcal{F})\leq\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}
                  \left\|A\right\|^{1/k}\text{ for all }k\geq1\] where
                  $\rho(A)$ denotes the spectral radius of $A$ and
                  $\left\|~\right\|$ is any sub-multiplicative norm.
                  Furthermore, the right hand side converges to
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$ (see
                  \emph{G.-C.~Rota} and \emph{W.~G.~Strang}
                  \cite{RotaStr:IM60}) and the $\limsup$ of the left hand
                  side is also equal to $\rho(\mathcal{F})$. The set
                  $\mathcal{F}$ is said to have the finiteness property if
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ is equal to $\rho(A)^{1/k}$ for some
                  $k$ and some $A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}$. Although not every
                  finite set $\mathcal{F}$ has the finiteness property, there
                  are some important classes of sets of matrices which do
                  have this property, and when this holds there may be more
                  efficient ways to compute the value of
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$.\par The first part of the present
                  paper proves that if $\mathcal{F}$ contains at most one
                  matrix of rank $>1$, then $\mathcal{F}$ has the finiteness
                  property. Moreover, if all matrices in $\mathcal{F}$ have
                  rank $1$ and $k$ is the least value for which there there
                  exists $A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}$ such that
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})=\rho(A)^{1/k}$, then $A$ is a product of
                  $k$ distinct matrices from $\mathcal{F}$. In this special
                  case, for small sets $\mathcal{F}$, this gives an efficient
                  way to compute $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ (see also
                  \emph{A.~A.~Ahmadi} and \emph{P.~A.~Parrilo}
                  \cite{AhmPar:CDC12}). To extend beyond this limited case,
                  the authors consider the set $P(\mathcal{F}_{k})$ of rank
                  one approximations to the elements in $\mathcal{F}_{k}$
                  (which may be obtained using singular value decompositions)
                  and prove that $\rho(\mathcal{F})=
                  \lim\sup_{k\rightarrow\infty}\rho(P(\mathcal{F}_{k}))^{1/k}$.
                  In the special case where each matrix in $\mathcal{F}$ has
                  nonnegative real entries and some product of matrices in
                  $\mathcal{F}$ has all entries $>0$, there is a simpler
                  formula: $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ is equal to the limit of
                  $\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}~(\text{tr}~A)^{1/k}$ as
                  $k\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical examples are given to show
                  how these formulae may be used in practice.",

                  students and graduate students in engineering, science,
                  mathematics, and computer science. Prerequisites for
                  students using this book are a good working knowledge of
                  calculus, probability theory and linear algebra.\par This
                  textbook is not just any textbook on information theory.
                  Besides the usual topics covered in a conventional course
                  on information theory (Shannon theory, parctical solutions
                  to communication problems, etc.), this text brings Bayesian
                  data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods,
                  clustering algorithms, and neural networks. The author
                  takes the point-of-view that information theory and machine
                  learning belong together. He manages to convince the reader
                  of this viewpoint by continually showing the connections
                  between seemingly unrelated topics. As Bob McEliece is
                  quoted, ``An instant classic. ... You'll want two copies of
                  this astonishing book, one for the office and one for the
                  fireside at home.''\par After some introductory chapters,
                  the author turns to data compression, looking at the source
                  coding theorem, symbol and stream codes, and codes for
                  integers. Noisy-channel coding is the next main topic of
                  interest, which includes a nice discussion of correlated
                  random variables and their relation to communication. Other
                  topics in information theory, such as hash codes, binary
                  codes, and message passing, are also included. Students
                  will certainly not want to miss Chapter 19, entitled, ``Why
                  have sex?''\par Part IV deals with probabilities and
                  inference, using exact methods, deterministic
                  approximations, and Monte Carlo methods to solve a variety
                  of problems in information theory (decoding, inferring
                  clusters from data, interpolation through noisy data,
                  classifying patterns given labeled examples). This sets the
                  scene for Part V on neural networks. The author presents
                  some basic models coming from simple learning algorithms to
                  whet the readers appetite for further independent reading.
                  Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines, and multilayer
                  networks are included. This part concludes with a
                  discussion on image denoising.\par The final part deals
                  with sparse graph codes. The reader is introduced to the
                  following codes for error-correction: LDPC (or Gallager),
                  convolution, turbo, repeat accumulation, as well as to the
                  digital fountain codes for erasure correction. After a
                  discussion of each of these codes, the author arrives at
                  the conclusion that the best solution to the communication
                  problem is to ``combine a simple, pseudo-random code with a
                  message-passing decoder''.\par Appendices on notation, some
                  physics (namely phase transitions), and some mathematics (a
                  brief review of finite fields, eigenvectors, and
                  perturbation theory) can be found at the end of the book.",

                  its, generalized spectral radius $\rho(\Sigma)$ is defined
                  as the lim sup of the maximal $n^{\text{th}}$ root of the

                  the use of sophisticated tools from many different fields

                  assumption that the matrices span a nilpotent Lie algebra.
                  In 1995, Gurvits conjectured that nilpotency implies that
                  these products are, in some sense, simple. More precisely,
                  there exists a uniform bound l such that any product can be
                  represented as a product of no more than I matrix
                  exponentials. This conjecture has important applications in
                  the analysis of linear switched systems, as it is closely
                  related to the problem of reachability using a uniformly
                  bounded number of switches. It is also closely related to
                  the concept of nice reachability for bilinear control
                  systems. The conjecture is trivially true for the case of
                  first-order nilpotency. Gurvits proved the conjecture for
                  the case of second-order nilpotency using the
                  Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We show that the
                  conjecture is false for the third-order nilpotent case
                  using an explicit counterexample. Yet, the underlying
                  philosophy behind Gurvits' conjecture is valid in the case
                  of third-order nilpotency. Namely, such systems do satisfy
                  the following nice reachability property: any point in the
                  reachable set can be reached using a piecewise constant
                  control with no more than four switches. We show that even
                  this form of finite reachability is no longer true for the
                  case of fifth-order nilpotency.",

                  made a breakthrough in the problem of the joint spectral
                  radius computation, developing the invariant polytope
                  algorithm which for most matrix families finds the exact
                  value of the joint spectral radius. This algorithm found
                  many applications in problems of functional analysis,
                  approximation theory, combinatorics, etc.. In this paper we
                  propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm
                  making it roughly 3 times faster and suitable for higher
                  dimensions. The modified version works for most matrix
                  families of dimensions up to 25, for non-negative matrices
                  the dimension is up to three thousand. Besides we introduce

                  continuous circle maps homotopic to the identity, torus

                  bibliography. What is called ``proofs'' are usually only
                  short ideas of the proofs. The reader is advised either to

                  radii of finite products of those matrices. The proof rests
                  on a theorem asserting the existence of a continuous
                  invariant splitting for certain matrix cocycles defined
                  over a minimal homeomorphism and having the property that
                  all forward products are uniformly bounded.\par Given
                  $\mathbf{A}$ a bounded nonempty set of $d\times d$ complex
                  matrices. The joint spectral radius of $\mathbf{A}$
                  introduced by Rota and Strang is \[\varrho(\mathbf{A}) :=

                  A_i\in\mathbf{A}\}\] where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes any norm on
                  $\mathbb{C}^d$. Berger-Wang formula asserts that
                  \[\varrho(\mathbf{A}) =

                  radius of a matrix $A$. The rate of convergence of

                  more general result is obtained when $\mathbf{A}$ is
                  nonempty compact. The proof rests on a structure theorem

                  the product are taken in arbitrary order from an infinite
                  sequence of matrices $\{A_i\}$. In the case of stochastic
                  matrices, such general products have been considered by
                  \emph{E.~Seneta} [Non-negative matrices and Markov chains,
                  Springer (1981)]. \par In two main theorems, the authors
                  give sufficient conditions for such a product to be bounded
                  and to be convergent to zero, respectively. These
                  conditions use the matrix submultiplicative norm $\mu$ and
                  are based on the convergence of $\sum_i
                  [\max(\mu(A_i),1)-1]$ and divergence of $\sum_i
                  [1-\min(\mu(A_i),1)]$, respectively. \par The proofs are
                  based on classical theorems related with the products of
                  positive numbers. The results obtained are used to deduce a
                  condition for weak ergodicity of inhomogeneous Markov
                  chain. Also the ergodicity coefficient based on the matrix
                  norm is compared with other ergodicity coefficients
                  considered, for example, in a paper by \emph{A. Rhodius}

                  undergraduate real analysis background, but the selection
                  of topics is slanted toward relevance for economic theory.
                  Thus, e.g., there is a good bit of order theory, convex
                  analysis, optimization, dynamic programming and calculus of
                  variations, but no Fourier analysis, Hilbert space or
                  spectral theory. The author takes some pains to give proofs
                  that provide understanding and to avoid unmotivated tricks.
                  The book is divided into four parts.\par Part I, Set
                  theory, includes preliminaries of real analysis (set
                  theory, complete ordered fields, countability). Part II,
                  Analysis on metric spaces, includes metric spaces
                  (connectedness, separability, compactness, fixed point
                  theorems, applications to functional equations, products of
                  metric speaces) and continuity, including
                  Stone-Weierstrass, Arzela-Ascoli, Brouwer fixed point
                  theorems, dynamic programming, Nash equilibrium. Part III,
                  Analysis on linear spaces, introduces linear spaces, linear
                  operators and functionals, utility theory, Shapley value,
                  convexity, and a chapter on economic applications (expected
                  utility theory, welfare economics, information theory,
                  financial economics, cooperative games). Part IV, Analysis
                  on metric/normed linear spaces, includes basics of normed
                  linear spaces, Banach spaces, fixed point theory, bounded
                  linear operators and functionals, convex analysis in normed
                  linear spaces, and a chapter on differential calculus
                  (Frechet differentiation, generalized mean value theorem,
                  optimization, calculus of variations). Exercises in each
                  chapter are distributed among the various sections, and
                  certain ones are marked as ``must do'' ones that will be

                  The book should be quite successful for its intended
                  purpose.",

                  algorithms for the approximation of their exponential
                  growth rate. The framework is applicable to any system for
                  which the switching sequence is constrained to be in a
                  regular language. These systems are referred to as
                  constrained switching systems. Arbitrary switching systems
                  are a special case of constrained switching systems. We
                  introduce the algebraic concept of multinorms, which
                  characterizes the stability of a constrained switching
                  system. Then, building upon this tool, we develop the first
                  arbitrary accurate approximation schemes for estimating the
                  constrained joint spectral radius $\hat{\rho}$ -- that is,
                  the exponential growth rate -- of a system. For a given
                  bound $r > 0$, the algorithms provide an estimate of
                  $\hat{\rho}$ within the range $[\hat{\rho},
                  (1+r)\hat{\rho}]$. They boil down to solving a convex
                  optimization program involving LMIs, for which the

                  admit arbitrary switching systems as special cases.\par
                  Using recent results of \emph{X.~Dai}~\cite{Dai:LAA12} on
                  the asymptotic growth rate of such systems, we introduce
                  the concept of \emph{multinorm} as an algebraic tool for
                  stability analysis.\par We conjugate this tool with two
                  families of multiple quadratic Lyapunov functions,
                  parameterized by an integer $T \geq 1$, and obtain converse
                  Lyapunov Theorems for each.\par Lyapunov functions of the
                  first family associate one quadratic form per state of the
                  automaton defining the switching sequences. They are made
                  to decrease after every $T$ successive time steps. The
                  second family is made of the \textit{path-dependent}
                  Lyapunov functions of Lee and Dullerud. They are
                  parameterized by an amount of memory $(T-1) \geq 0$.\par
                  Our converse Lyapunov theorems are finite. More precisely,
                  we give sufficient conditions on the asymptotic growth rate
                  of a stable system under which one can compute an integer
                  parameter $T \geq 1$ for which both types of Lyapunov
                  functions exist. As a corollary of our results, we
                  formulate an arbitrary accurate approximation scheme for
                  estimating the asymptotic growth rate of switching systems

                  linear operators acting in finite-dimensional Eucledian
                  space. The main idea is to use the invariant sets of of
                  these operators. It is shown that any irreducible family of
                  operators possesses a centrally-symmetric invariant compact
                  set, not necessarily unique. The Minkowski norm generated
                  by the convex hull of an invariant set (invariant body)
                  possesses special extremal properties that can be put to
                  good use in exploring the joint spectral radius. In
                  particular, approximation of the invariant bodies by
                  polytopes gives an algorithm for computing the joint
                  spectral radius with a prescribed relative deviation
                  $\varepsilon$. This algorithm is polynomial with respect to
                  $1/\varepsilon$ if the dimension is fixed. Another
                  direction of our research is the asymptotic behavior of the
                  orbit of an arbitrary point under the action of all
                  products of given operators. We observe some relations
                  between the constants of the asymptotic estimations and the
                  sizes of the invariant bodies. In the last section we give

                  independently from given compact sets (row uncertainty
                  sets). If all the uncertainty sets are finite or

                  simple Barabanov norm, which moreover, can be efficiently
                  computed. In this paper we classify all possible Barabanov
                  norms for discrete-time systems. We prove that, under mild
                  assumptions, such norms are unique and are either
                  piecewise-linear or piecewise quadratic. Those assumptions
                  can be verified algorithmically and the numerical
                  experiments show that a vast majority of systems satisfy
                  them. For some narrow classes of systems, there are more
                  complicated Barabanov norms but they can still be
                  classified and constructed. Using those results we find all
                  trajectories of the fastest growth. They turn out to be
                  eventually periodic with special periods. Examples and
                  numerical results are presented.",

 annote        = "We introduce a new approach to evaluate the largest Lyapunov
                  exponent of a family of nonnegative matrices. The method is
                  based on using special positive homogeneous functionals on
                  $\mathbb{R}^d_+$, which gives iterative lower and upper
                  bounds for the Lyapunov exponent. They improve previously
                  known bounds and converge to the real value. The rate of
                  converges is estimated and the efficiency of the algorithm
                  is demonstrated on several problems from applications (in
                  functional analysis, combinatorics, and language theory)
                  and on numerical examples with randomly generated matrices.
                  The method computes the Lyapunov exponent with a prescribed
                  accuracy in relatively high dimensions (up to 60). We
                  generalize this approach to all matrices, not necessarily
                  nonnegative, derive a new universal upper bound for the
                  Lyapunov exponent, and show that such a lower bound, in
                  general, does not exist.",

                  radii of domains of strong and weak attraction.
                  Furthermore, strong and weak generating functions and their

                  $\mathcal{S}(\Sigma)$ denotes the multiplicative semigroup

                  $A$, $\sigma(A)$ and $r(A)$ denote the spectrum of $A$ and
                  the spectral radius of $A$, respectively. A set
                  $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is said to be
                  simultaneously Schur stable if $r(A)\le 1$, for every $A\in

                  for every $A\in \Sigma$.\par The main theorem states that
                  for a bounded set $\Sigma$ of $n\times n$ complex matrices,

                  $n\times n$ complex matrices, the essential nature of
                  simultaneous Schur stability is that zero is the only
                  projection in the semigroup.\par Finally, three conjectures

                  systems gives rise to a number of interesting and
                  challenging mathematical problems. The objective of this
                  paper is to outline some of these problems, to review
                  progress made in solving them in a number of diverse
                  communities, and to review some problems that remain open.
                  An important contribution of our work is to bring together
                  material from several areas of research and to present
                  results in a unified manner. We begin our review by
                  relating the stability problem for switched linear systems
                  and a class of linear differential inclusions. Closely
                  related to the concept of stability are the notions of
                  exponential growth rates and converse Lyapunov theorems,
                  both of which are discussed in detail. In particular,
                  results on common quadratic Lyapunov functions and
                  piecewise linear Lyapunov functions are presented, as they
                  represent constructive methods for proving stability and
                  also represent problems in which significant progress has
                  been made. We also comment on the inherent difficulty in
                  determining stability of switched systems in general, which
                  is exemplified by NP-hardness and undecidability results.
                  We then proceed by considering the stability of switched
                  systems in which there are constraints on the switching
                  rules, through both dwell-time requirements and
                  state-dependent switching laws. Also in this case the
                  theory of Lyapunov functions and the existence of converse
                  theorems are reviewed. We briefly comment on the classical
                  Lur'e problem and on the theory of stability radii, both of
                  which contain many of the features of switched systems and
                  are rich sources of practical results on the topic. Finally
                  we present a list of questions and open problems which
                  provide motivation for continued research in this area.",

                  W.~Wojty{\'n}ski [Stud. Math. 49, 263--273 (1977)] showed
                  that locally finite Lie algebras of compact operators have
                  invariant subspaces. The question remained open for general
                  Lie algebras of Volterra operators. This question is
                  answered in the affirmative here.\par The authors use
                  semigroups of principle operators (operators whose spectral
                  radius coincides with their essential spectral radius). It
                  is shown that if one such semigroup contains the group
                  $\left\{e^{tT}, t\in\mathbb{R}\right\}$ for some nonzero
                  Volterra operator $T$, then it has a hyperinvariant
                  subspace. This gives the existence of hyperinvariant
                  subspaces for Lie algebras of Volterra operators.\par The
                  paper contains many accompanying results which are of
                  independent interest. In particular, it is proved that the
                  joint spectral radius is a subharmonic function: let $D$ be
                  a domain on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ and $\lambda\in
                  D\to M(\lambda)$ be a map into the set of bounded subsets
                  of a Banach algebra $A$. The map $\lambda\to M(\lambda)$ is
                  said \emph{to be analytic} if there exists a family $F$ of
                  analytic function $f: D\to A$ such that
                  $M(\lambda)=\{f(\lambda): f \in F\}$ for all $\lambda\in
                  D$. The family $F$ is called \emph{an analytic family for
                  the map} $\lambda\to M(\lambda)$. We say that $F$ is
                  continuous at a point $\lambda_0 \in D$ if $\sup\{\|f
                  (\lambda)- f(\lambda_0)\| : f \in F\}\to 0$ under
                  $\lambda\to 0$, $\lambda\in D$. Also, $F$ is
                  \emph{continuous} on $D$ if it is continuous at every point
                  of $D$. Sometimes it is written $F(\lambda)$ instead of
                  $M(\lambda)$.\par Theorem 3.5. \emph{Let $\lambda\to
                  M(\lambda)$, $\lambda\in D$, be an analytic map into the
                  set of bounded subsets of $A$ with analytic family $F$. If
                  $F$ is continuous on $D$ then the functions $\lambda\to\log
                  \rho(M(\lambda))$ and $\lambda\to \rho(M(\lambda))$ are
                  subharmonic on $D$.}",

 annote        = "The spectral radius of a matrix is a widely used concept in
                  linear algebra. It expresses the asymptotic growth rate of
                  successive powers of the matrix. This concept can be
                  extended to sets of matrices, leading to the notion of
                  ``joint spectral radius''. The joint spectral radius of a
                  set of matrices was defined in the 1960's, but has only
                  been used extensively since the 1990's. This concept is
                  useful to study the behavior of multi-agent systems, to
                  determine the continuity of wavelet basis functions or for
                  expressing the capacity of binary codes. Although the joint
                  spectral radius shares some properties with the usual
                  spectral radius, it is much harder to compute, and the
                  problem of approximating it is NP-hard. In this thesis, we
                  first review theoretical results that lead to basic
                  approximations of the joint spectral radius. Then, we list
                  various specific cases where it is effectively computable,
                  before presenting a specific type of sets of matrices, for
                  which we solve the problem of computing it with a
                  polynomial computational cost.",

                  the maximal asymptotic rate of growth of a product of
                  matrices taken in this set, when the length of the product
                  increases. It is known to be very hard to compute. In
                  recent years, many different methods have been proposed to
                  approximate it. These methods have different advantages,
                  depending on the application considered, the type of
                  matrices considered, the desired accuracy or running time,
                  etc. The goal of this toolbox is to provide the practioner
                  with the best available methods, and propose an easy tool
                  for the researcher to compare the different methods.\par
                  The JSR Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox that provides a large
                  set of methods for the approximation of the joint spectral
                  radius, but also includes several helper functions, for
                  example for comparison or analysis purposes, and several
                  demonstration functions. One important feature is that the
                  toolbox offers a ``default'' algorithm that computes bounds
                  on the joint spectral radius by combining several
                  approaches presented in this article. This may be useful if
                  one does not know what algorithm is more suitable. The
                  behavior of this algorithm may also be parameterized as
                  needed, for instance by setting a maximal computation time
                  or by fine-tuning a particular step in an algorithm. The
                  main steps of the default algorithm are the following:
                  \begin{itemize} \item Try to transform the problem into a
                  set of smaller independent problems. This is possible when
                  the matrices in the set $\Sigma$ are simultaneously
                  blocktriangularizable. \item If the matrices are
                  nonnegative, start with the pruning algorithm in order to
                  get some bounds $[\beta^-, \beta^+]$ on the joint spectral
                  radius, then compute the joint conic radius, using the
                  positive orthant as cone, and the ellipsoidal norm
                  approximation using $[\beta^-, \beta^+]$ as initial bounds.
                  \item If some matrices have negative entries, start with a
                  variant of Gripenberg's algorithm in order to get some
                  initial bounds and a candidate product. This variant may
                  rescale the matrices during the computation in order to
                  avoid overflows. After this first step, compute the
                  ellipsoidal norm approximation and, if needed, try to
                  certify optimality or to find a better candidate product
                  using a balanced complex polytope method or a conitope
                  method, which is a lifted polytope method. \end{itemize}",

                  of a set of matrices, i.e., the maximal asymptotic growth
                  rate of products of matrices taken in that set. The Joint
                  Spectral Radius has a wide range of applications, including
                  switched and hybrid systems, combinatorial words theory, or
                  the study of wavelets. However, it is notoriously difficult
                  to compute or approximate; it is actually uncomputable, and
                  its approximation is NP-hard. The toolbox compiles several
                  recent computation and approximation methods, and also
                  contains an automatic blackbox method for inexperienced
                  users, selecting the most appropriate methods based on an
                  automatic study of the matrix set provided. The tool is

                  ``forbidden products'' remained open. We prove that the

                  restriction circular shifts and their mirror images

                  all have the same spectral radius for any pair $\{A,B\}$ of

                  $\mathcal{M}\subset\mathbb{K}^{n\times n}$, where
                  $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Consider the
                  discrete linear inclusion $x(t+1)\in\{Ax(t):A\in
                  \mathcal{M}\}$. A solution to this inclusion is a sequence
                  $\{x(t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$, such that for every
                  $t\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $A(t)\in\mathcal{M}$ with
                  $x(t+1)=A(t)x(t)$. The sets of products of length $t$ are
                  defined as: $\mathcal{S}_t =\{A(t-1)A(t-2)\cdots
                  A(0):A(s)\in\mathcal{M}, s=0,1,\ldots ,t-1\}$ and the
                  semigroup given by
                  $\mathcal{S}=\bigcup_{t=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{S}_t$.\par Let
                  $\rho(A)$ denote the spectral radius of $A$ and let
                  $\|\cdot\|$ be some operator norm on $ \mathbb{K}^{n\times
                  n}$. Define for $t\in\mathbb{N}$,
                  $\bar{\rho}_t(\mathcal{M}):=\sup\{r(S_t)^{1/t} : S_t
                  \in\mathcal{S}_t\}$ and
                  $\hat{\rho}_t(\mathcal{M}):=\sup\{\|S_t\|^{1/t} :S_t
                  \in\mathcal{S}_t\}$ Then the joint spectral radius and the
                  generalized spectral radius are respectively defined as
                  $\bar{\rho}(\mathcal{M}):=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}
                  \sup\bar{\rho}_t(\mathcal{M})$ and
                  $\hat{\rho}(\mathcal{M}):=\lim_{t\rightarrow
                  \infty}\hat{\rho}_t(\mathcal{M})$. It is well known that
                  $\bar{\rho}(\mathcal{M})=\hat{\rho}(\mathcal{M})$.
                  $\mathcal{M}$ is called irreducible, if only the trivial
                  subspaces $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{K}^n$ are invariant under
                  all matrices $A\in\mathcal{M}$, otherwise $\mathcal{M}$ is
                  called reducible. The semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ is
                  irreducible if and only if the set $\mathcal{M}$ is
                  irreducible.\par The author proves that the generalized
                  spectral radius of a compact set of matrices is a strictly
                  increasing function of the set. The main tool in the proof
                  is the observation that if $\mathcal{M}$ is convex, is not
                  a singleton set, and the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ generated
                  by $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\sigma(S)\subset\{0\}\cup
                  \{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z| =1\},\forall
                  S\in\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{M})$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is
                  reducible.\par Some applications of this property in the
                  area of time-varying stability radii are discussed. In
                  particular, using the implicit function theorem sufficient
                  conditions for Lipschitz continuity are derived.",

                  system that consists of several linear subsystems: Given a
                  finite set of $n\times n$ matrices and an $n$-dimensional
                  vector, find a sequence of $K$ matrices, each chosen from
                  the given set of matrices, to maximize a convex function
                  over the product of the $K$ matrices and the given vector.
                  This simple problem has many applications in operations
                  research and control, yet a moderate-sized instance is
                  challenging to solve to optimality for state-of-the-art
                  optimization software. We propose a simple exact algorithm
                  for this problem. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time
                  when the given set of matrices has the \emph{oligo-vertex}
                  property, a concept we introduce in this paper for a set of
                  matrices. We derive several sufficient conditions for a set
                  of matrices to have the oligo-vertex property. Numerical
                  results demonstrate the clear advantage of our algorithm in
                  solving large-sized instances of the problem over one
                  state-of-the-art global solver. We also pose several open
                  questions on the oligo-vertex property and discuss its
                  potential connection with the finiteness property of a set
                  of matrices, which may be of independent interest.",

                  numerical technique for the stability analysis of linear

                  which allow refinable families of polytopes of adjustable

                  the existence of a \emph{polyhedral Lyapunov function} that
                  is common to a family of asymptotically stable subsystems
                  can be checked efficiently via simple iterative algorithms.
                  The technique can be used to prove the stability of
                  switched linear systems, classes of linear time-varying
                  systems and Linear Differential Inclusions. We also present
